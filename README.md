Hi Mugurel

I had to spend an hour or so  getting myself up to speed on Cloudformation as I come form a terraform background, and likewise with Chef , so hopefully these look ok

I think i missed one of the bonus questions on CF, but hopefully everything else is there and working 

FYI, ive used argparse on my python script, so the syntax is , for example ...

./getBeersGreaterThan.py --abv 6

Thanks
Gary
